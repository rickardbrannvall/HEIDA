Implements scoring algorithm for cardiac disease risk under homomorphic encryption (TFHE). The risk factor based algorithm is taken from Carpov and Constantino (2016), and is implemented in the Concrete library for computation on the Torus with Fully Homomorphic Encryption (TFHE) in the Python programming language.
